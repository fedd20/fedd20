<h3 align="center">Welcome to my page!</h1>
My nickname is imperialwool or toaster-61 (last nick is newer, will try to move to this nick).

I like to make projects that can be useful or can give bunch of new ideas what we can do new or convinient.

My open-source projects:

- [o!SFC](https://github.com/imperialwool/osu-songs-folder-cleaner) to clear empty maps from songs folder in osu!
- [telelibonphp](https://github.com/imperialwool/telelibonphp) to make easy bots on PHP (old and never will be updated)

My closed-source projects:

- ~~[fontbox](https://fontbox.t61.link/) that contains free for personal use fonts~~ died bcause i havent server for this project rn
- [Raya-Prime](https://rayaprime.t61.link/) - bot in Aminoapps to prevent spam and for fun
